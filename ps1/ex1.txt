AMATH 583 PS1 Write Up - Wyatt Scherer - Due 4/6/2020

1. What is the host name of the computer as reported by your linux environment? 

Using the hostname command: Wyatts-MacBook-Pro.local

2. How would you specify the name of an output file when you use the compiler if you wanted the object to have a name other than a.out?

Use the -o flag at the end of the compile statement to define the output file name like such: '$ c++ cpp_file.cpp -o output_file_name.out'

3. What happens if you type '$ a.out'?

On Mac I get: 'bash: a.out: command not found'. Without defining a path to the object file, the bash shell interprets the command as a bash shell command. 
The addition of './a.out' tells the shell that the object file a.out resides in the current directory defined by './'. This specifies to the shell which file to execute.

4. What does clang print when you run '$ c++ --version'?

Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.7.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin

5.(AMATH 583 only). What do the -I and -l flags do in the command we used to build a.out?

The -I (eye) flag adds the specified directory to the search path for include files. In this homework, this flag includes the path to the python2.7 header file for inclusion in compiling a.out.
The -l (ell) flag indicates to compile against shared libraries. In this homework, this flag indicates to compile against the included python2.7 library files to access the relevant commands.
